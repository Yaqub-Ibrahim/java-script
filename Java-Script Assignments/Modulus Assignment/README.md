# Modulus Assignments
Description of Assignment

**Under Construction**

Situation: Return even and then odd numbers to two specific number, must be at least 20 number apart

Simple Expectations
- Begin with two hardcoded variables (able to change this in the console, a way of grading and simulating user-initiated content)
- Log to the Console, using subtraction, how far apart these numbers are
- Return the odd numbers between these two variables
- Return even numbers between two hardcoded variables
- Concatenate the answers to know which is which when these are printed out

Intermediate Expectations
- Return the amount of odd numbers
- Return the amount of even numbers
- Use an array data structure to store the even numbers and odd numbers separately
- Use an array structure to create a memory of the actual sequence used

Modulus Assignment Expectations and Case Study Guide (use Starting JavaScript too)
- Create a program that skip counts through a sequence of 20 numbers
- For each even number, save it into an evenArray
- For each odd number, save it into an oddArray
- Output to the console ...
  1. The entire sequence of numbers
  2. All the numbers in the sequence that are even
  3. All the numbers in the sequence that are odd

Coding Concepts to try to include
- Tertiary Operator

Starting JavaScript
```JavaScript
let number = [___, ___]; //Boundary Numbers
let skipCount = ___; //Number of skipCounting between each element of the sequence, used in FOR Loop
let difference = number[] - number[]; //Difference, mandatory expectation
let startingNumber = number[]; //Hint: used in the FOR Loop
for (let i=0; i<=difference; i++){
  even = (startingNumber += skipCount) % 2;
  console.log("This number is", even, "; This iteration is number", i+skipCount); //Example of Concatenating
}
```
