-write down the marks gotten, then divide them by the number of assignments to get the mean.

-85% or greater is an A

-95 to 100% is an A+

-80 to 85 is an A-

-we need to take the mean and put it into the filter, if mean >89 get an A, if mean >79 is a B
if mean >69 get a C, if mean >59 getr a D, if mean <= 59 get an F. We should order it like this, so when paired with a
return statement, let's say the greade is 

-let creates a variable that can be anything, const makes a variable that can only be one thing, the variable will
never change.

-replace const with let

-replace average with marks
