operator class notes-

-parameters and arguments will be a struggle

-Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.

-Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.

-Ex:functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    code to be executed
}

  

-we made a parameter for skips, Ex: skipCount *=3.

-we start skip counting at 15, due to the code "let skipCount = 15;"

-in 
  "let number = 0;
  for (let i=1; i<=5; i++){
    skipCount*= 3;
    console.log(skipCount);
  }"

"skipCount*=3;" we can choose what we skip count by, you can also change the "*" to "+" or "/" depending on what
operation you want to use.

"i<=5;" let's you choose how many times you want to skip count by

"let number = 0;" let's you choose which number to start at

first you must choose the operation and what you want to skip count by, then how many times you want to do it,
then what you start at.

-"console.log(1==1);
console.log('1'==1);
console.log('1'===1);"

on the second line of code == makes the number after it a string, but in line 3 because there's 3 = signs, it cant't be a
string. in the first line it's just comparing numbers so there is no string creation because there was no string before.




-"while (number <= 100) {
  let number = 0;
  console.log(number);
  number +=5;

}"

is an infinite loop because  number is 0, then it gets printed to log, then gets added by 5 to equal 5, then equals to
zero once again. it is why "let number" should always go first
