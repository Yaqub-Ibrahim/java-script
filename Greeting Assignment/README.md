# Greeting Assignments
Description of Assignment

**Under Construction**

Problem Situation: How do you greet someone based on the hour, time dependent (ELL Lesson)

Solution Expectations
- Hard Code a Variable and set it to the "current time" (able to change this in the console, a way of grading and simulating user-initiated content)
  - Note: variable is in hours only
  - Might be easier to use 24-hour clock
- Logic for Feedback:
  - If hour is between 6am and 12pm, then return "Good Morning!"
  - If hour is between 12pm and 6am, then return "Good Afternoon!"
  - Otherwise, return, "Good Evening!"
- CAUTION: are the times given *really* the times for "Good Evening!"
- CAUTION: how do we define 6am & 12pm as <= || >= || < || >

Develop Algorithm
- Define variable as hour and set boundaries for time
- 00:00 is midnight or 12am
- What if's: variable typeof must be an integer between, inclusive, 0 and 12
- Use an image of a clock, analogue, with digital output to define boundaries
- Write expressions
- Use expressions in code

Advanced Error Checking (beginning examples of user initiated mistakes)
- what if someone types ```one``` instead of ```1``` (typeof string variable instead of number variable)
- what if someone types ```thriteen``` instead of ```thirteen``` (spelling mistake)
- what if someone types ```12AM``` or ```12 AM``` instead of ```12``` or ```twelve```
  - Note: a more accurate solution requires string functions, currently beyond the scope of these notes
- how might a 24-hour clock be converted to a 12-hour clock

Starter Code using If-elseIf-else structure
```JavaScript
let hour = 10; //Change this simulating automatically reading time from Internet Clock or System Tray Clock
if () console.log('Good Morning');
else if () console.log('Good Afternoon');
else if () console.console.log('Good Afternoon');
else console.console.log();
```
